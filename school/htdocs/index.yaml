  content: !str:RedCloth::TextileDoc "No one told you Hobix was hard. Yeah, it\xE2\x80\x99s so hard it sunk a battle cruiser. But papa says everyone on the battlecruiser had brushed their teeth and was tucked in and their little Monkey-Brite Nightlights were bolted into the wall so they went peacefully.\n\n\
    Don\xE2\x80\x99t get sunk like they did. Enroll in \"tutorials\":http://sl33p3r.free.fr/hobix-tutorials/hobix-tutorials.html by Frederick Ros. He knows so many secrets, nobody here at Hobix Finishing School had a clue how much you could do.\n\n\
    I\xE2\x80\x99m telling you: the tutorial here is nothing in comparison. Robert Brook is, however, collecting \"tips\":http://robertbrook.com/hobix/tips.html. While Lyle takes pushpins and tacks up \"the choicest speciments\":http://del.icio.us/lyle/hobix.\n"

AND CUPS!! But he can do simple addition now HE CAN DO LONG DIVISION NOW he can grow wild moss naturally around his picture frames HE CAN TWIST HIS BLUE GLASSES UNTIL THEY HAVE A SQUIRREL PATTERN and (but) most of all he can move you away from Werdprreyss\xE2\x80\xA6\n\n\
